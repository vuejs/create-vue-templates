# jsx-router-cypress

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
pnpm build
```

### Run Headed Component Tests with [Cypress Component Testing](https://on.cypress.io/component)

```sh
pnpm test:unit:dev # or `pnpm test:unit` for headless testing
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
pnpm test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm test:e2e
```
